# Hugo Asset Management

This utility helps manage the assets under the `static/` subdirectory of your [Hugo][1] installation:
* Find broken links (missing assets)
* Find assets that are not linked to anywhere in the content so you can reclaim the disk space

Just run it under your hugo directory, just as you would `hugo` itself.
